# 0x13. C - Bit manipulation

20180306
The purpose of this project is to introduce bit manipulation in C

### 0-binary_to_uint.c
converts a binary number to an unsigned int using bitwise operators

### 0-binary_to_uint.c-old
converts a binary number to an unsigned int without bitwise operators

### 1-print_binary.c
prints the binary representation of a number

### 2-get_bit.c
returns the value of a bit at a given index

### 3-set_bit.c
sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index

### 4-clear_bit.c
sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index

### 5-flip_bits.c
returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
