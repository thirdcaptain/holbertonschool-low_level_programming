0x1D. C - Search Algorithms

20180807 - The purpose of this project is to introduce space complexity in search algorithms

### 0-linear.c
function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm

### 1-binary.c
function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm

### 2-O
time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n

### 3-0
space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n

### 4-0
time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n

### 5-0
space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n

### 6-0
space complexity of a provided function/algorithm
