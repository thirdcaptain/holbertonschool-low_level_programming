# 0x1A. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

20180525
The purpose of this project is to introduce sorting algorithms and Big O

### 0-bubble_sort.c, 0-O
a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
0-O, the big O notation of the time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm:
in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case

### 1-insertion_sort_list.c, 1-O
a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
1-O, the big O notation of the time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm:
in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case

### 2-selection_sort.c, 2-O
a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
2-O, the big O notation of the time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm:
in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case

### 3-quick_sort.c, 3-O
a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
3-O, the big O notation of the time complexity of the bubble sort algorithm:
in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
